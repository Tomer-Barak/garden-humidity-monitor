![Garden Dashboard](web_ui/static/icons/garden-192.png)

## Introduction

The Garden Multi-Sensor Humidity Monitoring System is a comprehensive IoT solution designed to monitor soil moisture levels using ESP32 microcontrollers. The system provides real-time data collection, storage, and visualization capabilities through a web-based dashboard. This scalable architecture supports multiple sensors per device and offers historical data analysis for informed irrigation management.

## Overview

Optimal soil moisture management is essential for healthy plant growth and efficient water usage. Manual monitoring methods are labor-intensive and provide limited temporal coverage. This system addresses these challenges by providing automated, continuous monitoring capabilities with data logging and trend analysis.

## System Architecture

The system follows a tiered architecture with three main components that communicate with each other:

1. **ESP32 Microcontroller Layer**:
   - Each ESP32 device can connect up to 3 soil moisture sensors
   - Collects analog readings from sensors and converts them to digital values
   - Sends structured JSON payload data to the server via HTTP protocol
   - Operates on a configurable measurement interval

2. **Python Flask Server Layer**:
   - Acts as the central data processing hub
   - Exposes API endpoints to receive sensor data from ESP32 devices
   - Stores all measurements in a SQLite database (humidity.db)
   - Manages memory entries with a dedicated memories table
   - Serves the web dashboard and processes browser requests
   - Implements data retention and management policies

3. **Web Browser Interface Layer**:
   - Provides dashboard visualization of current and historical humidity data
   - Offers the Memory Book interface for collaborative garden journaling
   - Communicates with the server via HTTP requests
   - Receives both JSON data (for charts) and HTML (for page rendering)
   - Implements responsive design for cross-device compatibility

## Features

- **Multi-Sensor Support**: Each ESP32 can handle up to 3 sensors, with customizable configurations.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous data collection with adjustable intervals.
- **Data Storage**: Historical readings are stored in a SQLite database.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize trends, filter data by device or sensor, and view multiple sensors on the same chart.
- **Alert System**: Threshold-based notifications with customizable high/low humidity limits for each sensor individually, including optional Telegram bot integration.
- **Garden Memory Book**: A collaborative journaling system for tracking observations, discoveries, and gardening notes with emoji support and image attachments.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Mobile-responsive dashboard with offline capability for cross-platform access.
- **Automated Data Management**: Configurable data retention policies with automatic cleanup routines.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Hebrew/RTL text support for international users.

## Implementation Details

### ESP32 Firmware

The ESP32 microcontroller firmware performs analog-to-digital conversion of capacitive soil moisture sensor readings, applies calibration algorithms to convert raw values to humidity percentages, and transmits structured data to the server via HTTP POST requests. Each sensor is uniquely identified by name and GPIO pin assignment.

### Python Flask Server

The server application implements RESTful API endpoints for data ingestion and retrieval. It maintains persistent storage using SQLite database and provides both raw data access and aggregated statistics. The server also hosts the web dashboard and implements configurable data retention policies.

### Web Dashboard

The responsive web interface provides real-time monitoring capabilities and historical data visualization through interactive charts. Features include device and sensor filtering, multi-sensor comparison views, and mobile-optimized design patterns.

### Garden Memory Book

The Garden Memory Book is a collaborative journaling feature that enables family members and gardeners to document their observations, discoveries, and gardening experiences. This feature transforms the monitoring system from a purely technical tool into a shared family garden diary.

#### Key Features

- **Collaborative Journaling**: Multiple family members can contribute memories and observations
- **Rich Text Support**: Full emoji support with an organized emoji picker featuring 90+ garden-related emojis
- **Image Attachments**: Support for uploading and viewing garden photos alongside text entries
- **Persistent Storage**: All memories are stored in the database and persist across sessions
- **Multi-Language Support**: Hebrew/RTL text support with automatic text direction detection
- **Real-Time Sync**: Cross-tab communication ensures all open instances stay synchronized

#### Use Cases

The Memory Book bridges the gap between technical data and human experience:

- **Seasonal Observations**: "üå± First tomato sprouts appeared today! Humidity levels have been perfect at 65% üìä"
- **Problem Tracking**: "üêõ Found aphids on the roses üò∞ Applied organic spray üß¥ - let's monitor if humidity changes help"
- **Success Stories**: "üéâ First harvest of the season! ü•ïü•¨ The consistent moisture monitoring really paid off üëç"
- **Family Collaboration**: "üë®‚Äçüåæ Dad: Watered the garden this morning üíß" / "üë©‚Äçüåæ Mom: Plants look much happier now! üòä"
- **Learning Documentation**: "ü§î Noticed humidity drops quickly on sunny days ‚òÄÔ∏è - might need automatic watering system"

#### Technical Implementation

- **Database Storage**: Memories are stored with user names, timestamps, and full text content
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: localStorage-based communication keeps all browser tabs synchronized
- **Smart Text Direction**: Automatic Hebrew text detection with manual RTL/LTR toggle
- **User Persistence**: Browser remembers user names for quick future entries
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

This feature transforms raw sensor data into meaningful family memories, creating a comprehensive record of gardening experiences that combines technical insights with human observations.
